## Data collection and usage

### All slash commands
Each time you use a slash command, we store your Discord user ID and the name of the slash command you used in order to know the bot performance. This data is stored until the end of the month.

### /link_coc_account slash command
When you use the slash command /link_coc_account, we store your Discord user ID and your Clash of Clans player tag to link your accounts. You can unlink your accounts with /unlink_coc_account, and this data will be immediately deleted.

### Vote for the bot
If you vote for the bot on top.gg, we will store your Discord user ID to know who are our supports.
For the time being, this data is stored indefinitely, so you can contact us in the support server if you want us to delete this data.


## Data storage

Data is stored in a SQLite database. Only the bot developers can access this, in order to help the development of the bot. Data is not sold, provided to, nor shared with any third party.
The database is secured against external access, however, no guarantee is provided and the bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of data. In the event of an unauthorised data access, users will be notified through Discord.
