**This project is a Discord Bot about the game Clash Of Clans. It uses especially the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [coc.py](https://github.com/mathsman5133/coc.py) libraries.**

If you want to test the bot, you can [add it to your server](https://rreemmii-dev.github.io/invite). You can also join the [support server](https://discord.gg/KQmstPw) to test the bot or to ask for help.

## Installation + Setup

```shell
# Clone the main branch:
git clone https://github.com/rreemmii-dev/Clash-Of-Clans-Discord-Bot.git --single-branch

# Download the libraries:
pip install -r Clash-Of-Clans-Discord-Bot\requirements.txt
```

You must follow these steps to create and set up your bot:
- Create a bot following [these steps](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html). For your invite link, add the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes, and the required permissions given [here](data/data_source/useful.json) (or the `administrator` permission).
- You will need the [member privileged intent](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html#privileged-intents) to run the bot. If your bot is in more than 100 servers, you have to make a request for additional intents, which is usually satisfied within a week.
- Unzip [Emojis.zip](Emojis.zip). Then, create a server for each folder (you will have about 6 servers for emojis), and add emojis from each folder to the matching server. Finally, add your bot in each of these servers.

Once it's done, you have to edit the [bot/config.json](bot/config.json) file and fill in the [data/data_source/ids.json](data/data_source/ids.json). You have also to rename the [secure_folder_template](secure_folder_template) to "Secure Folder" and add your credentials in your [Secure Folder/login.json](secure_folder_template/login.json) file.

#### Help about the Secure Folder

</summary>

First, you have to rename the [secure_folder_template](secure_folder_template) to "Secure Folder".

Then, you have to fill in your [Secure Folder/login.json](secure_folder_template/login.json) file with your credentials. You can see in the following table when each field is required, and how to get the credential.
